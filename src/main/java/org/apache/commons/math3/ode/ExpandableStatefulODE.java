/**
 * This class represents a combined set of first order differential equations,
 * with at least a primary set of equations expandable by some sets of secondary
 * equations.
 * <p>
 * One typical use case is the computation of the Jacobian matrix for some ODE.
 * In this case, the primary set of equations corresponds to the raw ODE, and we
 * add to this set another bunch of secondary equations which represent the Jacobian
 * matrix of the primary set.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * We want the integrator to use <em>only</em> the primary set to estimate the
 * errors and hence the step sizes. It should <em>not</em> use the secondary
 * equations in this computation. The {@link AbstractIntegrator integrator} will
 * be able to know where the primary set ends and so where the secondary sets begin.
