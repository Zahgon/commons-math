/**
 * Polynomial interpolator using both sample values and sample derivatives.
 * <p>
 * The interpolation polynomials match all sample points, including both values
 * and provided derivatives. There is one polynomial for each component of
 * the values vector. All polynomials have the same degree. The degree of the
 * polynomials depends on the number of points and number of derivatives at each
 * point. For example the interpolation polynomials for n sample points without
 * any derivatives all have degree n-1. The interpolation polynomials for n
 * sample points with the two extreme points having value and first derivative
 * and the remaining points having value only all have degree n+1. The
 * interpolation polynomial for n sample points with value, first and second
 * derivative for all points all have degree 3n-1.
